Volunteer Skill Share

-This app would be used to allow volunteer organizations to find people with a certain skill that they need filled.
The person who is willing to volunteer, would make a short resume type profileof the skills that they have that volunteer organizations might be looking for.
A volunteer is able to search for the different non profits that have listed themselves on the app, to see if there is something that they are interested in that they have the skills for.
When they find one they are interested in, they are able to reach out for an introduction to the non profit to see if they would be a good fit.
Non profits will also be able to see the past organiations that a volunteer has worked with through the app to see what kind of history, involvment, and what skills the volunteer might bring to the table.
